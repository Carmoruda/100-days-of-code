# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 25 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the JetBrains Academy track: Python for begginers. I also began a new track, Python Developer, which also belongs to JetBrains Academy. For the start of the track I have selected the project "Coffee Machine" which has 6 phases and today I have completed 5 of them.

More concretely, not counting what I have studied today, the projects I have been working on today were: [Hangman: Stage 7/8](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Beginners/Hangman/Stage%207-8.py), [Hangman: Stage 8/8](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Beginners/Hangman/Stage%208-8.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 1/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%201-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 2/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%202-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 3/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%203-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 4/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%204-6.py) and [Coffee Machine: Stage 5/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%201-6.py)

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with some exercises, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Although I've been studying Python for a while now, it' s still quite new for me.

### Day 1: July 26 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't work on any project, instead, it has been a day of learning and practicing theory. I have been studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  in Python. I wanted to dedicate some time to it because I had already seen OOP in C++ but never in Python and, in addition, some concepts I didn't quite assimilate them the last time I worked on OOP. So today, I studied the theory of OOP and did some exercises in JetBrains Academy.

For all the reasons explained above I have not continued the Coffee Machine project, nor have I started another one. To sum up, today has been focused on learning and practicing OOP in Python.

**Thoughts**: The truth is that I enjoyed today a lot, since I have been able to complete my understanding of the different concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I was able to complete the exercises with almost no problems.

### Day 2: July 27 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Earlier today I continued studying OOP in Python and based on the knowledge I gained I finished stage 6 of the Coffee Machine project, which means that today I have completed the whole project.

**Thoughts**: I must admit that I am really enjoying OOP. All the features it offers seem great and help a lot when developing different projects.

### Day 3: July 28 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have been studying different probability concepts due to the fact that this project requires them. I have also begun a new project, Generating Randomness, and completed phases 1 and 2 of it.

**Thoughts**: To be honest today has not been very enjoyable, this has occurred because the explanations of probability and the instructions of the exercises and different phases of the project are not well developed and explained.

### Day 4: July 29 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: During the day I have continued studying the different concepts of probability, so I have not done any practical activities.

**Thoughts**: Today hasn't been very entertaining since the probability study is getting too dense for me.

### Day 5: July 30 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished studying probability and finally after four long days I have completed the Generating Randomness project. Specifically, I have completed the 3rd and 4th phases.

**Thoughts**: Being frank today has been average, meaning it hasn't been amazing, but it hasn't been the worst either. However, finishing the project has been a joy.

### Day 6: August 1 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: On this day I have completed phases 1 and 2 of the Dominoes Python project.

**Thoughts**: It was a good day today. In the second phase of the project I got stuck because it didn't like the way the text was printed, but apart from that, everything was great.

### Day 7: August 3 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on phase 3 of the Dominoes project. Although I didn't finish it, it was a productive day.

**Thoughts**: I want to leave the easy projects behind and start some more interesting ones.

### Day 8: August 5 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I know that for the last two days I haven't worked or studied any project, but I've been organizing github repositories, notes in Obsidian, etc. As for today's work, I have managed to finish phases 3 and 4 of the project (Dominoes).

**Thoughts**: This project is taking me longer than expected, looking forward to move on to a more interesting one.

### Day 9: August 8 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I recognize that I'm not working a lot these days, but I'm traveling so I'm working as much as I can. Today I migrated all the Simple Banking System project organization from Jira to JetBrains Space. Specifically in the programming area, today I have completed phases 1 and 2 of the project (Simple Banking System).

**Thoughts**: Although I'm only halfway through the project, I must admit that I'm really enjoying it. I missed having so much interest in a project.

### Day 10: August 9 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress**: So far today I have been studying different concepts of databases and SQL because the project requires them in order to continue developing code.

**Thoughts**: I have found the concepts I acquired today to be very intriguing and useful. The databases are extremely effective and efficient.

### Day 11: August 10 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I haven't had that much time to program/learn today, but in the time I have had I' ve been able to keep progressing with the various SQL and databases concepts.

**Thoughts**: Unlike with other projects, the knowledge I am acquiring seems very worthwhile and I can't wait to put it into practice in the project.

### Day 12: August 11 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have finished learning all concepts needed to develop the 3rd phase of the project.

**Thoughts**: In my humble opinion, databases are very intriguing and it' s a topic that I would like to learn more profoundly in the future.

### Day 13: August 12 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I have today finished the 3rd phase of the Simple Banking System project. It has been a really interesting phase and I have learned and put into practice a lot of new concepts.

**Thoughts**: It was very exciting when I managed to complete this phase, since I did not see myself able to complete it with all the SQL concepts it required.

### Day 14: August 13 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have finished the entire Simple Banking System project. This project has been fantastic, I have learned a lot about databases and SQL.

**Thoughts**: In my most sincere opinion, I believe that this is one of the most useful projects I've done so far and I think it is the one I have learned the most with, of course, for the moment.

### Day 15: August 14 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have started the Markdown Editor project. More concretely, today I've working in the stage 1 of this project.

**Thoughts**: Today was an easy and calm day because I already know the Markdown syntax, so I didnÂ´t have to put almost any effort into todays work.

### Day 16: August 16 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I haven't done much since I returned home from a vacation and I was a bit tired. Regardless of this, today I worked on phases 2 and 3 of the xxx project. I completed phase 2 and left half done phase 3.

**Thoughts**: I really appreciate the fact that I already know Markdown since it is facilitating me a lot the development of the project.

### Day 17: August 17 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have finished and optimized phase 3 of the Markdown Editor project.

**Thoughts**: Today has been quite useful for practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I have learned a lot about how to work with classes.

### Day 18: August 18 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have been learning different concepts such as: immutability, identity testing and lambda functions.

**Thoughts**: The different concepts I have acquired about mutability and immutability have turned out to be extremely valuable to me. On the other hand and to being honest, I don't believe that I will be using lambda functions very often.
