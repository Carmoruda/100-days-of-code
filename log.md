# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 25 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the JetBrains Academy track: Python for begginers. I also began a new track, Python Developer, which also belongs to JetBrains Academy. For the start of the track I have selected the project "Coffee Machine" which has 6 phases and today I have completed 5 of them.

More concretely, not counting what I have studied today, the projects I have been working on today were: [Hangman: Stage 7/8](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Beginners/Hangman/Stage%207-8.py), [Hangman: Stage 8/8](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Beginners/Hangman/Stage%208-8.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 1/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%201-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 2/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%202-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 3/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%203-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 4/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%204-6.py) and [Coffee Machine: Stage 5/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%201-6.py)

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with some exercises, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Although I've been studying Python for a while now, it' s still quite new for me.

### Day 1: July 26 2021, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't work on any project, instead, it has been a day of learning and practicing theory. I have been studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  in Python. I wanted to dedicate some time to it because I had already seen OOP in C++ but never in Python and, in addition, some concepts I didn't quite assimilate them the last time I worked on OOP. So today, I studied the theory of OOP and did some exercises in JetBrains Academy.

For all the reasons explained above I have not continued the Coffee Machine project, nor have I started another one. To sum up, today has been focused on learning and practicing OOP in Python.

**Thoughts**: The truth is that I enjoyed today a lot, since I have been able to complete my understanding of the different concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I was able to complete the exercises with almost no problems.

### Day 2: July 27 2021, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Earlier today I continued studying OOP in Python and based on the knowledge I gained I finished stage 6 of the Coffee Machine project, which means that today I have completed the whole project.

**Thoughts**: I must admit that I am really enjoying OOP. All the features it offers seem great and help a lot when developing different projects.

### Day 3: July 28 2021, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have been studying different probability concepts due to the fact that this project requires them. I have also begun a new project, Generating Randomness, and completed phases 1 and 2 of it.

**Thoughts**: To be honest today has not been very enjoyable, this has occurred because the explanations of probability and the instructions of the exercises and different phases of the project are not well developed and explained.

### Day 4: July 29 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: During the day I have continued studying the different concepts of probability, so I have not done any practical activities.

**Thoughts**: Ttoday hasn't been very entertaining since the probability study is getting too dense for me.

### Day 5: July 30 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have been studying different probability concepts due to the fact that this project requires them. I have also begun a new project, Generating Randomness, and completed phases 1 and 2 of it.

**Thoughts**: To be honest today has not been very enjoyable, this has occurred because the explanations of probability and the instructions of the exercises and different phases of the project are not well developed and explained.
